# COMPILER-DESIGN-BASICS-TASK-3
*COMPANY*:CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS
*NAME*: MATURI MEGHANA
*INTREN* ID:CT06DM781
*DOMAIN* : C PROGRAMMING
*DURATION*: 6WEEK
*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH
*TASK DISCRIPITION*
The goal of this project is to build a simple lexical analyzer in C that reads an input file (source code), then scans and classifies tokens into:
   1.Keywords (e.g., int, if, return)
   2.Operators (e.g., +, -, =, ==)
   3.Identifiers (e.g., variable/function names)
This lexical analyzer mimics the first phase of a compiler, providing foundational understanding of how source code is tokenized.
*TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES*
Tool/Technology	-Purpose
C Language        -	Core programming for implementing RLE logic
Turbo C++ / GCC	- IDE/compiler to run and build the program
Standard C Libraries -(stdio.h, conio.h)	File handling, input/output
Git & GitHub	- Version control and code hosting
ChatGPT, YouTube, Google- 	Reference and support resources
*PLATFORM*
Development Environment: Turbo C++ (DOS-based) and/or any modern C compiler like GCC (Code::Blocks / VS Code)
Operating System: Windows (Preferred for Turbo C++)
File Type Support: Plain text files (.txt)
Input & Output Method: Command-line interface
*APPLICATIONS*
Educational Use:
Teaches lexical analysis, a key compiler design concept.
Useful for students in:
Compiler Design
Systems Programming
Programming Language Concepts
Can be extended to build a mini compiler.
