# COMPILER-DESIGN-BASICS-TASK-3
*COMPANY*:CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS
*NAME*: MATURI MEGHANA
*INTREN* ID:CT06DM781
*DOMAIN* : C PROGRAMMING
*DURATION*: 6WEEK
*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH
*TASK DISCRIPITION*
The goal of this project is to build a simple lexical analyzer in C that reads an input file (source code), then scans and classifies tokens into:
   1.Keywords (e.g., int, if, return)
   2.Operators (e.g., +, -, =, ==)
   3.Identifiers (e.g., variable/function names)
This lexical analyzer mimics the first phase of a compiler, providing foundational understanding of how source code is tokenized.
*TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES*
Tool/Technology	                      Purpose
C Programming	           -           Core language for implementation
GCC/Clang                -          	Compiler
Text Editor              -         	VS Code, Notepad++, Code::Blocks
stdio.h, string.h, ctype.h	-        Standard C libraries use
*PLATFORM*
Turbo C++ (for educational DOS-based setups)
*APPLICATIONS*
Educational Use:
Teaches lexical analysis, a key compiler design concept.
Useful for students in:
Compiler Design
Systems Programming
Programming Language Concepts
Can be extended to build a mini compiler.
